## 🚀 Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- **Python 3.8+** (tested up to Python 3.12)
- **pip** package manager
- **MIDI interface** (optional, for MIDI control)

### Installation

1. **Clone or download this repository**

```bash
cd pythonic
```

2. **Create a virtual environment (recommended)**

```bash
python -m venv venv

# On Windows:
venv\Scripts\activate

# On macOS/Linux:
source venv/bin/activate
```

3. **Install dependencies**

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

> **Note**: If you encounter issues with `mido` or `python-rtmidi`, they're only required for MIDI functionality. The synth works without them.

### Run the Application

```bash
python run.py
```

Or use the provided shell script:

```bash
./run.sh
```

On first launch, Pythonic automatically creates:
- Configuration directory for preferences
- `Pythonic Presets` folder in your Documents
- Default factory presets

## 🎹 Usage

### Keyboard Controls

| Key | Action |
|-----|--------|
| `1-8` | Trigger drum channels 1-8 |
| `S` | Save preset |
| `L` | Load preset |

### Mouse Controls

- **Knobs**: Click and drag vertically
- **Sliders**: Click and drag horizontally
- **Buttons**: Click to toggle
- **Double-click knobs**: Reset to default
- **Mouse wheel**: Fine adjustment

### MIDI

1. Connect your MIDI controller
2. Launch Pythonic—it automatically detects MIDI devices
3. Map drum channels to MIDI notes (default: C1-G1)
4. Velocity-sensitive response on all channels

### Presets

**Loading**: Use the preset combo-box at the top of the window, or click the folder icon to browse

**Saving**: Click "Save Preset" button—the file browser opens in your preset folder

**Preset Location**: 
- Windows: `%USERPROFILE%\Documents\Pythonic Presets`
- macOS: `~/Documents/Pythonic Presets`
- Linux: `~/Documents/Pythonic Presets`

**Microtonic Compatibility**:
- Pythonic can import `.mtpreset` files from Soniccharge Microtonic
- Load drums and patterns directly from Microtonic presets
- Provides an open-source alternative workflow for Microtonic users

> **Note**: Pythonic uses its own synthesis engine. While it can read Microtonic presets, the resulting sounds may differ from the original due to differences in DSP implementation. Pythonic is an independent project and is not affiliated with, endorsed by, or sponsored by Sonic Charge or NuEdge Development. Microtonic™ is a trademark of Sonic Charge/NuEdge Development.

### Pattern Sequencer

**Basic Pattern Editing**:
- Click steps to toggle triggers, accents, and fills
- Adjust pattern length per channel
- Visual step indicator shows current playback position

**Per-Step Probability**:
- Enable probability mode to control the chance of each step triggering (0-100%)
- 100% = always plays, 50% = plays half the time, 0% = never plays
- Adds organic variation and humanization to patterns

**Substeps (Micro-Timing)**:
- Right-click any step to access substep menu
- Define subdivisions using 'o' (play) and '-' (skip) notation
- Examples: "oo-" = play twice then skip, "o-o-" = alternating hits
- Creates flams, rolls, and complex rhythmic variations within a single step

## 🎯 Factory Presets

Pythonic includes 8 built-in drum sounds:

1. **Kick** - Deep bass drum with exponential pitch sweep
2. **Snare** - Punchy snare with noise body
3. **Closed Hi-Hat** - Tight, crisp hi-hat
4. **Open Hi-Hat** - Sustaining open hi-hat
5. **High Tom** - Tuned high tom
6. **Low Tom** - Tuned low tom
7. **Clap** - Hand clap with modulated envelope
8. **Rim Shot** - Sharp rimshot click

## 🤖 AI Drum Generator

Pythonic includes an optional AI-powered drum generator that uses a Conditional Variational Autoencoder (CVAE) trained on hundreds of drum patches.

### Optional ML Installation

The generator requires PyTorch, which is **not** included in the base install to keep the app lightweight.

**Option A — In-app install**: Open the generator dialog (Preset menu → *AI Drum Generator...*) and click **Install ML Support**. This runs `pip install -r requirements-ml.txt` in the current environment after confirmation.

**Option B — Manual install**:

```bash
pip install -r requirements-ml.txt
```

> For GPU acceleration, install the appropriate CUDA/ROCm PyTorch variant first following [pytorch.org](https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally/). The CPU-only build works fine for inference.

### Loading a Model

The repository includes two pre-trained checkpoints:

| File | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `drum_cvae_best.pt` | Best validation loss during training |
| `drum_cvae_final.pt` | Final epoch checkpoint |

Point the generator to either file via the **Load Model...** button. The path is saved in preferences for next time.

### Generator Workflow

1. Open the preset menu and click **AI Drum Generator...**
2. Load a model checkpoint (`.pt` file)
3. Adjust **Temperature** (lower = conservative, higher = experimental), **Candidates** count, and optional **Seed** for reproducibility
4. Choose a drum type per slot using the dropdown (constrained to TR-8-style families)
5. Click **Generate** per slot or **Generate All 8**
6. Browse candidates with `<` / `>` arrows
7. **Preview** a single slot (one-shot) or **Loop Preview** the full pattern with generated drums overlaid on your current kit
8. Check the slots you want to keep and click **Apply Selected**

The live kit is never modified until you explicitly apply — preview is non-destructive.

### Slot Layout

| Slot | Label | Allowed Types |
|------|-------|---------------|
| 1 | BD | bd |
| 2 | SD | sd |
| 3 | CH | ch, shaker |
| 4 | OH | oh |
| 5 | TOM HI/PERC | tom, perc |
| 6 | TOM LO/PERC | tom, perc, cowbell |
| 7 | CLAP/RIM | clap, blip, zap, cowbell |
| 8 | CY/FX | cy, fx, fuzz, reverse, synth, bass, other |

## ⚙️ Technical Specifications

- **Sample Rate**: 44.1 kHz (CD quality)
- **Bit Depth**: 32-bit float internal processing
- **Audio Backend**: PortAudio via `sounddevice`
- **Latency**: ~11.6ms (512-sample buffer, configurable)
- **MIDI Backend**: RtMidi via `python-rtmidi` and `mido`
- **GUI Framework**: Tkinter (cross-platform)

## 🧪 Testing

Run the test suite:

```bash
./run_tests.sh
```

Or manually:

```bash
pytest tests/ -v
```

The test suite includes:
- Synthesis accuracy validation
- Audio output comparison tests
- Pattern manager functionality
- Reference WAV generation

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### No Audio Output

1. Verify `sounddevice` installation: `pip install --upgrade sounddevice`
2. Check system audio output device is working
3. Try increasing buffer size in [gui/main_window.py](gui/main_window.py)
4. List available devices: `python -c "import sounddevice; print(sounddevice.query_devices())"`

### MIDI Not Working

1. Ensure your MIDI device is connected before launching
2. Check if `mido` and `python-rtmidi` are installed
3. On Linux, you may need ALSA MIDI permissions
4. Test MIDI: `python test_midi_input.py`

### High CPU Usage

- Increase audio buffer size (reduces real-time load)
- Disable unused effects (Reverb, Delay)
- Close other audio applications
- Use fewer simultaneous voices

### Installation Issues

**macOS**: May need to install PortAudio: `brew install portaudio`  
**Linux**: Install dependencies: `sudo apt install python3-dev portaudio19-dev libasound2-dev libjack-dev`  
**Windows**: Usually works out of the box with pip
